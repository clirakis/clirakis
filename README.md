- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clirakis - Chris Lirakis
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning things. Everything here is some hobby project to learn about a physical thing. I play with Arduino, Raspberry-Pi. 
I mostly program in C and C++. I know python, but not well 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use python better and re-educate myself on how to do distributed processes better. (I'm still stuck in writing my own wrappers 
around raw TCP/IP calls)
